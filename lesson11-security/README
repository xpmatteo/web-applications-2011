* Create a users table.  It should contain the login, hashed password, email and any other information you might want about the user.
* Add a registration page, so that users can create a login for themselves
* Add a page that allows a logged in user to change their password, email, and any other profile information that you save about them.

== INSTALLATION ==

=== a) Create databases

execute 
  script/create_databases.sh
  
=== b) Create a symlink to the development database configuration

  cd config
  ln -s development.rb current_configuration.rb

=== c) Configure Apache

Add the following content to your Apache configuration. This usually goes in a
file quotes-service.conf in /etc/apache2/other or /etc/apache2/sites-available.
Substitute /some-path/quotes-service for the actual path where your app resides.

  <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName quotes

      ErrorLog /some-path/quotes-service/log/error.log    
      CustomLog /some-path/quotes-service/log/access.log common
      DocumentRoot /some-path/quotes-service/public

      <Directory /some-path/quotes-service/public>
        AllowOverride All      
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
      </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>

Add the following content to your /etc/hosts file

  127.0.0.1 quotes
  
Note that the name of the service "quotes" must be the same that appears in
the ServerName directive. Verify that the installation is correct by
executing

  apachectl -t

Then restart Apache with

  sudo apachectl restart

=== d) Test 
  
Open http://quotes/ in your browser.  You should see the service.
