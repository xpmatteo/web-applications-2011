== Objectives for this lesson

* Learn how to work with the database
* Learn how to setup the workstation from scratch quickly (script/create_databases)
* New library for dealing with Mysql (lib/database.rb)
* Reimplemented data access in quotes.rb with database
* Learn how to deal with separate configurations for development, test and production (see config/*)
* Learn how to write automated tests for getting early feedback on the quality of our code
* Learn how to control dependencies in the architecture of the application.  The dispatch.cgi script is completely decoupled from the database schema.  Only quotes.rb (our persistence layer) and the actual templates *.rhtml need to change when the schema changes.

You will need to install Mysql, rubygems and the mysql gem (gem install mysql).



== EXERCISES

* Implement /quotes/edit and /quotes/update

== PREREQUISITES ==

* Any Unix OS.  Linux, BSD, MacOS goes.
* Ruby 1.8.7.  (For Ubuntu: apt-get install ruby-full)
* Apache Httpd 
* Mysql 5
* Rubygems and the mysql gem

== INSTALLATION ==

=== a) Create databases

execute 
  script/create_databases.sh
  
=== b) Create a symlink to the development database configuration

  cd config
  ln -s development.rb current_configuration.rb

=== c) Configure Apache

Add the following content to your Apache configuration. This usually goes in a
file quotes-service.conf in /etc/apache2/other or /etc/apache2/sites-available.
Substitute /some-path/quotes-service for the actual path where your app resides.

  <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName quotes

      ErrorLog /some-path/quotes-service/log/error.log    
      CustomLog /some-path/quotes-service/log/access.log common
      DocumentRoot /some-path/quotes-service/public

      <Directory /some-path/quotes-service/public>
        AllowOverride All      
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
      </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>

Add the following content to your /etc/hosts file

  127.0.0.1 quotes
  
Note that the name of the service "quotes" must be the same that appears in
the ServerName directive. Verify that the installation is correct by
executing

  apachectl -t

Then restart Apache with

  sudo apachectl restart

=== d) Test 
  
Open http://quotes/ in your browser.  You should see the service.
